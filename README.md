**STypeS** 

Nonrecursive Datalog Rewriter for Linear TGDs and
Conjunctive Queries

STYPES rewrites ontology-mediated (OMQ) queries to equivalent
nonrecursive datalog queries (NDL) by getting as input:
 
- a on ontology in the form of linear tuple-generating dependencies (TGD)s   
- a conjunctive queries (CQ)
 

STYPES produces a polynomial-size rewritings whenever
the treewidth of the input CQs and the size of the chase
for the ontology atoms are bounded; moreover, the rewriting can be
constructed and executed in LogCFL, which is optimal in order 
to be evaluated in an high parallelizable environments as Apache Flink.

In order to compile and use from console STypeS  
it is necessary to build the application. 

From terminal command line execute the following:

```
sbt 'set test in assembly := {}' clean assembly 
```

The command  above  will create a jar file in "./target/scala-2.11/stypes_2.11-1.0.jar"

STypeS takes three inputs:
* an n ontology O, which is a set of linear tgds
* a conjunctive query CQ 
* the CQ's tree decomposition (T, Î») in a standard GML form.

In order to execute the NDL-rewriting algorithm we need to use and execute 
the jar created above:  java -cp stypes-assembly-1.0.jar <CQ> <GML> <O>

example:
```
cd ./target/scala-2.11/
java -cp stypes-assembly-1.0.jar uk.ac.bbk.dcs.stypes.App ../../src/test/resources/q09.cq ../../src/test/resources/q09.gml ../../src/test/resources/lines.dlp

```
